# design_pattern_ontology
The goal of this project is to create and maintain a design pattern ontology for software engineering.

The ontology consists of several modules. The detailed and very fine grained steps of creating the ontology modules are commented in the earliest Git commits. Sooner commits, being coarse grained, are less commented because they follow the same method of ontology module creation.
